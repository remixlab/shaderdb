Description:
Sphere subdivision using the geometry shader.
However, the GS shouldn't be used to perform tessellation because it process the output primitives sequentially w/out parallelization.

Useful applications of the GS recalculate normals after vertex displacement primitive distortion (e.g.: explode geometry along the normals) normal and edge rendering geometry culling
